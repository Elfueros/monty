***Monty 0.98 interpreter***

* This repository holds the files of my custom interpreter for Monty 0.98.

* It is a project for my ALX Software Engineering program at Holberton School

* Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes

* It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it.

* Monty 0.98 is like Python but is also a very very simple low level language.

***Go for code!***
